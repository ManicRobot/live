# packages

This folder contains the following files:

* **base-packages.txt** - This file contains minimal packages necessary for apt and chroot. Order is important in this list!
* **install-packages.txt** - This file contains packages that installed in both the Live ISO and the installment of Nalux
* **live-packages.txt** - This file contains packages that are only installed inside the Live ISO
* **pool-packages.txt** - This file contains packages that may or may not be needed (like special drivers or bootloaders) for the installment and thus are added to the CD-ROM repo
* **remove-packages.txt** - This file contains packages that are removed from both the Live ISO and the installment of Nalux after package installation
